Those natural – as contrasted with engineered, which here means: deliberately executed – units which do exist in the realm of occurrents are typically either parasitic on the existence of natural units on the continuant side, or they are fiat in nature. Thus we can count lives; we can count football games; we can count chemical reactions performed in experiments or in chemical manufacturing. We cannot count the processes taking place, for instance, in an episode of insect mating behavior.Even where natural units are identifiable, for example cycles in a cyclical process such as the beating of a heart or an organism’s sleep/wake cycle, the processes in question form a sequence with no discontinuities (temporal gaps) of the sort that we find for instance where billiard balls or zebrafish or planets are separated by clear spatial gaps. Lives of organisms are process units, but they too unfold in a continuous series from other, prior processes such as fertilization, and they unfold in turn in continuous series of post-life processes such as post-mortem decay.

Such units play a central role in almost all domains of natural science from particle physics to cosmology. Many scientific laws govern the units in question, employing general terms (such as ‘molecule’ or ‘planet’) referring to the types and subtypes of units, and also to the types and subtypes of the processes through which such units develop and interact. The division of reality into such natural units is at the heart of biological science, as also is the fact that these units may form higher-level units (as cells form multicellular organisms) and that they may also form aggregates of units, for example as cells form portions of tissue and organs form families, herds, breeds, species, and so on. At the same time, the division of certain portions of reality into engineered units (manufactured artifacts) is the basis of modern industrial technology, which rests on the distributed mass production of engineered parts through division of labor and on their assembly into larger, compound units such as cars and laptops. The division of portions of reality into units is one starting point for the phenomenon of counting." xsd:string

A body of water does not have to be still or contained; Rivers, streams, canals, and other geographical features where water moves from one place to another are also considered bodies of water.

The exact definition of a mineral is under debate, especially with respect to the requirement a valid species be abiogenic, and to a lesser extent with regards to it having an ordered atomic structure.

def: "Soil is an environmental material which is primarily composed of minerals, varying proportions of sand, silt, and clay, organic material such as humus, gases, liquids, and a broad range of resident micro- and macroorganisms." [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil]
comment: 'In engineering terms, soil is referred to as regolith, or loose rock material that lies above the 'solid geology'. Soil is commonly referred to as "earth" or "dirt"; technically, the term "dirt" should be restricted to displaced soil.' https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil\n\n" The upper limit of soil is the boundary between soil and air, shallow water, live plants, or plant materials that have not begun to decompose. Areas are not considered to have soil if the surface is permanently covered by water too deep (typically more than 2.5 meters) for the growth of rooted plants.\n\nThe lower boundary that separates soil from the nonsoil underneath is most difficult to define. Soil consists of horizons near the Earth's surface that, in contrast to the underlying parent material, have been altered by the interactions of climate, relief, and living organisms over time. Commonly, soil grades at its lower boundary to hard rock or to earthy materials virtually devoid of animals, roots, or other marks of biological activity. For purposes of classification, the lower boundary of soil is arbitrarily set at 200 cm."

comment: This class is distinct from a geometric surface, which is two-dimensional. The idea of "uppermost" may be problematic. Further, the definition of layer (the superclass of surface in rev 133) references surface. This may be another issue. Perhaps this can be made into an inferred class using 'bounding layer of' some material entity, note that 'bounding layer' implies containment, which may not be valid here.

def: "Silt is granular material of a size somewhere between sand and clay whose mineral origin is quartz and feldspar." [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silt]
comment: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ In the Udden-Wentworth scale (due to Krumbein), silt particles range between 0.0039 to 0.0625 mm, larger than clay but smaller than sand particles. ISO 14688 grades silts between 0.002 mm and 0.063 mm. In actuality, silt is chemically distinct from clay, and unlike clay, grains of silt are approximately the same size in all dimensions; furthermore, their size ranges overlap. Clays are formed from thin plate-shaped particles held together by electrostatic forces, so present a cohesion. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture Soil Texture Classification system, the sand-silt distinction is made at the 0.05 mm particle size. The USDA system has been adopted by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). In the Unified Soil Classification System (USCS) and the AASHTO Soil Classification system, the sand-silt distinction is made at the 0.075 mm particle size (i.e., material passing the #200 sieve). Silts and clays are distinguished mechanically by their plasticity.

def: "A subtropical condition is an environmental condition in which an envrionmental system receives more solar irradiance than those with temperate conditions, but less than those with tropical conditions. At low elevations, this typically results in eight months of the year having average temperatures greater than or equal to 10 degrees Celsius with the coldest monthly temperature averaging between 2 and 13 degrees Celsius." []
comment: As with most other climatic zones and conditions, multiple classification schemes have somehat different definitions and criteria. To quote from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ "Several methods have been used to define the subtropical climate. In the Trewartha climate classification, a subtropical region should have at least eight months with a mean temperature of 10 °C (50.0 °F) or above. German climatologists Carl Troll and Karlheinz Paffen defined Warm temperate zones as plain and hilly lands having an average temperature of the coldest month between 2 °C (35.6 °F) and 13 °C (55.4 °F) in the Northern Hemisphere and between 6 °C (42.8 °F) and 13 °C (55.4 °F) in the Southern Hemisphere, excluding oceanic and continental climates. According to the Troll-Paffen climate classification, there generally exists one large subtropical zone named the warm-temperate subtropical zone,[4] which is subdivided into seven smaller areas.[5]\n\nAccording to the E. Neef climate classification, the subtropical zone is divided into two parts: Rainy winters of the west sides and Eastern subtropical climate.[6] According to the Wilhelm Lauer & Peter Frankenberg climate classification, the subtropical zone is divided into three parts: high-continental, continental, and maritime.[7] According to the Siegmund/Frankenberg climate classification, subtropical is one of six climate zones in the world.[8]"

comment: ENVO contains this top-level class, but all instances will be in GAZ. The definition is preliminary and will be aligned to BFO.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/  Ecozones correspond to the floristic kingdoms of botany or zoogeographic regions of zoology. Ecozones are characterized by the evolutionary history of the organisms they contain. They are distinct from biomes, also known as major habitat types, which are divisions of the Earth's surface based on life form, or the adaptation of plants and animals to climatic, soil, and other conditions. Biomes are characterized by similar climax vegetation. Each ecozone may include a number of different biomes. A tropical moist broadleaf forest in Central America, for example, may be similar to one in New Guinea in its vegetation type and structure, climate, soils, etc., but these forests are inhabited by plants and animals with very different evolutionary histories.

def: "A planet which has a surface layer that nearly completely or completely covered by ice, and which has a substantial portion of its mass composed of ice." [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_planet]
comment: While this planetary form is still mostly theoretical, strong candidates exist such as OGLE-2005-BLG-390Lb, OGLE-2013-BLG-0341L b and MOA-2007-BLG-192Lb. Pluto was considered an ice planet until its reclassification in 2006 CE.  Surface temperatures of ice planets would have to be below 260 K (−13°C) if composed primarily of water, below 180 K (−93°C) if primarily composed of CO2 and ammonia, and below 80 K (−193°C) if composed primarily of methane. {xref="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_planet"}

comment: A helium planet might form via hydrogen evaporation from a gaseous planet orbiting close to a star. Low-mass white dwarfs may transition into objects which are essentially helium planets by hydrogen depletion through mass transfer to a massive object such as a neutron star.  Gliese 436 b is a candidate helium planet. {xref="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium_planet"}

comment: Materials which are usually assessed when appraising geodiversity include minerals, rocks, sediments, fossils, soils and water. Landforms factored into geodiversity metrics typically include folds, faults, and other expressions of morphology or relations between units of earth material. Natural processes that are included in measures of geodiversity are those which either maintain or change materials or geoforms, including tectonics, sediment transport, and pedogenesis. Geodiversity does not usually factor in anthropogenic entities. {xref=""}

comment: "The most valuable of the marine mineral resources is petroleum. About 15% of the world's oil is produced offshore, and extraction capabilities are advancing. One of the largest environmental impacts of deep sea mining are discharged sediment plumes which disperse with ocean currents and thus may negatively influence the marine ecosystem. Coal deposits known as extensions of land deposits , are mined under the sea floor in Japan and England." {xref="https://www.eionet.europa.eu/gemet/en/concept/14956"}

When this term is used for annotation, it indicates that no information was available about the molecular function of the gene product annotated as of the date the annotation was made; the evidence code "no data" (ND), is used to indicate this. Despite its name, this is not a type of 'function' in the sense typically defined by upper ontologies such as Basic Formal Ontology (BFO). It is instead a BFO:process carried out by a single gene product or complex.

Signal transduction begins with reception of a signal (e.g. a ligand binding to a receptor or receptor activation by a stimulus such as light), or for signal transduction in the absence of ligand, signal-withdrawal or the activity of a constitutively active receptor. Signal transduction ends with regulation of a downstream cellular process, e.g. regulation of transcription or regulation of a metabolic process. Signal transduction covers signaling from receptors located on the surface of the cell and signaling via molecules located within the cell. For signaling between cells, signal transduction is restricted to events at and within the receiving cell." [GOC:go_curators, GOC:mtg_signaling_feb11]
comment: Note that signal transduction is defined broadly to include a ligand interacting with a receptor, downstream signaling steps and a response being triggered. A change in form of the signal in every step is not necessary. Note that in many cases the end of this process is regulation of the initiation of transcription. Note that specific transcription factors may be annotated to this term, but core/general transcription machinery such as RNA polymerase should not.

def: "A stable assembly of two or more macromolecules, i.e. proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates or lipids, in which at least one component is a protein and the constituent parts function together." [GOC:dos, GOC:mah]
comment: A protein complex in this context is meant as a stable set of interacting proteins which can be co-purified by an acceptable method, and where the complex has been shown to exist as an isolated, functional unit in vivo. Acceptable experimental methods include stringent protein purification followed by detection of protein interaction. The following methods should be considered non-acceptable: simple immunoprecipitation, pull-down experiments from cell extracts without further purification, colocalization and 2-hybrid screening. Interactions that should not be captured as protein complexes include: 1) enzyme/substrate, receptor/ligand or any similar transient interactions, unless these are a critical part of the complex assembly or are required e.g. for the receptor to be functional; 2) proteins associated in a pull-down/co-immunoprecipitation assay with no functional link or any evidence that this is a defined biological entity rather than a loose-affinity complex; 3) any complex where the only evidence is based on genetic interaction data; 4) partial complexes, where some subunits (e.g. transmembrane ones) cannot be expressed as recombinant proteins and are excluded from experiments (in this case, independent evidence is necessary to find out the composition of the full complex, if known). Interactions that may be captured as protein complexes include: 1) enzyme/substrate or receptor/ligand if the complex can only assemble and become functional in the presence of both classes of subunits; 2) complexes where one of the members has not been shown to be physically linked to the other(s), but is a homologue of, and has the same functionality as, a protein that has been experimentally demonstrated to form a complex with the other member(s); 3) complexes whose existence is accepted based on localization and pharmacological studies, but for which experimental evidence is not yet available for the complex as a whole.

It leaves open if an organization is a material entity or a dependent continuant, as no consensus was reached on that.  The current placement as material is therefore temporary, in order to move forward with development. Here is the entire email summary, on which the definition is based:\n\n1) there are organization_member_roles (president, treasurer, branch\neditor), with individual persons as bearers\n\n2) there are organization_roles (employer, owner, vendor, patent holder)\n\n3) an organization has a charter / rules / bylaws, which specify what roles\nthere are, how they should be realized, and how to modify the\ncharter/rules/bylaws themselves.\n\nIt is debatable what the organization itself is (some kind of dependent\ncontinuant or an aggregate of people). This also determines who/what the\nbearer of organization_roles' are. My personal favorite is still to define\norganization as a kind of 'legal entity', but thinking it through leads to\nall kinds of questions that are clearly outside the scope of OBI.\n\nInterestingly enough, it does not seem to matter much where we place\norganization itself, as long as we can subclass it (University, Corporation,\nGovernment Agency, Hospital), instantiate it (Affymetrix, NCBI, NIH, ISO,\nW3C, University of Oklahoma), and have it play roles.\n\nThis leads to my proposal: We define organization through the statements 1 -\n3 above, but without an 'is a' statement for now. We can leave it in its\ncurrent place in the is_a hierarchy (material entity) or move it up to\n'continuant'. We leave further clarifications to BFO, and close this issue\nfor now." xsd:string

property_value: IAO:0000116 "2012-12-17 JAO: In common lab usage, there is a distinction made between devices and reagents that is difficult to model. Therefore we have chosen to specifically exclude reagents from the definition of \"device\", and are enumerating the types of roles that a reagent can perform.\n\n2013-6-5 MHB: The following clarifications are outcomes of the May 2013 Philly Workshop. Reagents are distinguished from devices that also participate in scientific techniques by the fact that reagents are chemical or biological in nature and necessarily participate in some chemical interaction or reaction during the realization of their experimental role. By contrast, devices do not participate in such chemical reactions/interactions.  Note that there are cases where devices use reagent components during their operation, where the reagent-device distinction is less clear.  For example:\n\n(1) An HPLC machine is considered a device, but has a column that holds a stationary phase resin as an operational component.  This resin qualifies as a device if it participates purely in size exclusion, but bears a reagent role that is realized in the running of a column if it interacts electrostatically or chemically with the evaluant. The container the resin is in (“the column”) considered alone is a device. So the entire column as well as the entire HPLC machine are devices that have a reagent as an operating part.\n\n(2) A pH meter is a device, but its electrode component bears a reagent role in virtue of its interacting directly with the evaluant in execution of an assay.\n\n(3) A gel running  box  is a device that has a metallic lead as a component that participates in a chemical reaction with the running buffer when a charge is passed through it.  This metallic lead is considered to have a reagent role as a component of this device realized in the running of a gel.\n\nIn the examples above, a reagent is an operational component of a device, but the device itself does not realize a reagent role (as bearing a reagent role is not transitive across the part_of relation).  In this way, the asserted disjointness between a reagent and device holds, as both roles are never realized in the same bearer during execution of an assay.  " xsd:string

def: "A processed material comprised of a collection of cultured cells that has been continuously maintained together in culture and shares a common propagation history." []
comment: The extent of a 'cultured cell population' is restricted only in that all cell members must share a propagation history (ie be derived through a common lineage of passages from an initial culture). In being defined in this way, this class can be used to refer to the populations that researchers actually use in the practice of science - ie are the inputs to culturing, experimentation, and sharing. The cells in such populations will be a relatively uniform population as they have experienced similar selective pressures due to their continuous co-propagation. And this population will also have a single passage number, again owing to their common passaging history. Cultured cell populations represent only a collection of cells (ie do not include media, culture dishes, etc), and include populations of cultured unicellular organisms or cultured multicellular organism cells. They can exist under active culture, stored in a quiescent state for future use, or applied experimentally.

def: "A k-means clustering is a data transformation which achieves a class discovery or partitioning objective, which takes as input a collection of objects (represented as points in multidimensional space) and which partitions them into a specified number k of clusters. The algorithm attempts to find the centers of natural clusters in the data. The most common form of the algorithm starts by partitioning the input points into k initial sets, either at random or using some heuristic data. It then calculates the mean point, or centroid, of each set. It constructs a new partition by associating each point with the closest centroid. Then the centroids are recalculated for the new clusters, and the algorithm repeated by alternate applications of these two steps until convergence, which is obtained when the points no longer switch clusters (or alternatively centroids are no longer changed)."

def: "a process through which a new type of cell culture or cell line is created, either through the isolation and culture of one or more cells from a fresh source, or the deliberate experimental modification of an existing cell culture (e.g passaging a primary culture to become a secondary culture or line, or the immortalization or stable genetic modification of an existing culture or line)." []
comment: A 'cell culture' as used here referes to a new lineage of cells in culture deriving from a single biological source.. New cultures are established through the initial isolation and culturing of cells from an organismal source, or through changes in an existing cell culture or line that result in a new culture with unique characteristics.  This can occur through the passaging/selection of a primary culture into a secondary culture or line, or experimental modifications of an existing cell culture or line such as an immortalization process or other stable genetic modification. This class covers establishment of cultures of either multicellular organism cells or unicellular organisms.

Typically we will be interested in stronger relations, for example in the relation immediately_preceded_by, or in relations which combine preceded_by with a condition to the effect that the corresponding instances of P and P1 share participants, or that their participants are connected by relations of derivation, or (as a first step along the road to a treatment of causality) that the one process in some way affects (for example, initiates or regulates) the other." xsd:string

property_value: IAO:0000116 "This branch of the ontology deals with causal relations between entities. It is divided into two branches: causal relations between occurrents/processes, and causal relations between material entities. We take an 'activity flow-centric approach', with the former as primary, and define causal relations between material entities in terms of causal relations between occurrents.\n\nTo define causal relations in an activity-flow type network, we make use of 3 primitives:\n\n * Temporal: how do the intervals of the two occurrents relate? \n * Is the causal relation regulatory?\n * Is the influence positive or negative\n\nThe first of these can be formalized in terms of the Allen Interval Algebra. Informally, the 3 bins we care about are 'direct', 'indirect' or overlapping. Note that all causal relations should be classified under a RO temporal relation (see the branch under 'temporally related to'). Note that all causal relations are temporal, but not all temporal relations are causal. Two occurrents can be related in time without being causally connected. We take causal influence to be primitive, elucidated as being such that has the upstream changed, some qualities of the donwstream would necessarily be modified.\n\nFor the second, we consider a relationship to be regulatory if the system in which the activities occur is capable of altering the relationship to achieve some objective. This could include changing the rate of production of a molecule.\n\nFor the third, we consider the effect of the upstream process on the output(s) of the downstream process. If the level of output is increased, or the rate of production of the output is increased, then the direction is increased. Direction can be positive, negative or neutral or capable of either direction. Two positives in succession yield a positive, two negatives in succession yield a positive, otherwise the default assumption is that the net effect is canceled and the influence is neutral.\n\nEach of these 3 primitives can be composed to yield a cross-product of different relation types." xsd:string
