# Planet Microbe Ontology

The Planet Microbe cyberinfrastructure system for marine microbiology brings together canonical marine datasets (such as HOT, TARA, OSD) into a unified platform, which leverages ontology terms to annotate, standardize and make the datasets metadata findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR). 

In order to manage the planet microbe semantic layer and enable datasets to be made interoperable, an application ontology, the Planet Microbe Ontology (PMO) was created. PMO imports terms from a variety of Open Biomedical Ontology and Library Foundry (OBO) ontologies. Including the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) for upper level terms, the Relations Ontology (RO) for relationships linking terms, the Environment Ontology for descriptions of environments, the Information Artifact Ontology (IAO) to describe information content entities, the Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI) for the description of scientific investigations, the Phenotype And Trait Ontology (PATO) for the description of phenotypic qualities (properties, attributes or characteristics), and finally the Units of measurement ontology (UO) for the description of data units.
